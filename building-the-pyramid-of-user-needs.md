Title: **Building the Pyramid of User Needs**

Duration: 30min

Tags: Quality, Accessibility, Performance, Security 

**tl;dr**

Users and developers have different perspectives on software quality. In this talk, we'll explore the difference between user experience and developer experience and we’ll have a closer look at the user expectations and needs: from basic accessibility all the way to the delightful experience at the top of their pyramid of needs.

**Abstract**

If you ask people using the software we build what 'quality' means, what would they say? It's safe to assume 'code coverage’ and ‘clean architecture' won't be on top of their list. In this talk, we'll explore the difference between user experience and developer experience. While doing this, we will also look deeper at user experience, beyond the user desires and delights and define the pyramid of user needs: from the basic accessibility, to a secure and safe environment, to a fast and cost effective experience and all the way to the delightful experience at the top.

**Long Version**

Think about software quality. What are the first thoughts that pop up? Clean architecture? Code coverage? If so, that’s fine. After all, this is what we learn; we are constantly being told to value clean code and to care deeply about reusability and scalability. But what about our users? What do they care about?

In this talk, I’m going to define software quality from user’s perspective. We will understand the difference between user experience and developer experience. While doing this, we will also looks deeper at user experience, beyond the user desires and delights and define the pyramid of user needs: from the basic accessibility, to a secure and safe environment, to a fast and cost effective experience and all the way to the delightful experience at the top.

Then we’re going to address the user needs in the context of building web applications: accessibility, security, performance. We will explore metrics, tools and practices that you can use in your project to build an accessible, inclusive, faster and safer experience for everyone and, by doing this, to ensure a baseline for software quality.

**Content and Outline**

The aim of the talk is to showcase the struggles of the modern web development ecosystem, the constant fight between what the user needs and what the developer wants to build.

* What do users see when they look at websites?
* The difference between UX and DX
* Our definition of software quality (from the DX perspective)
* What is UX? Why we only think about the tip of the iceberg
* Needs vs Delights, building a pyramid of priorities
* The 3 pillars of software quality (including tools and practices)
    * Accessibility
    * Security
    * Performance
* Building a team culture around the user needs
* Empathy Driven Development
