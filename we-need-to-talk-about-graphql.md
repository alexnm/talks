I'm going to briefly present what GraphQL is and what it isn't. We're going to have a lot of fun with some nice demos going through the main features of the GraphQL ecosystem. We will try to understand why GraphQL is worth learning and what advantages does it have over traditional REST APIs.

This is an approximate structure of the talk:
* Introduction to the query language
* Understand where it’s coming from
* Queries, Mutations, Subscriptions
* Implementing a GraphQL endpoint
* Introduction to Apollo and React-Apollo
* Full Stack GraphQL, let’s look at some examples
* Pros and cons for using it
