**Abstract**

Full stack is thrown around these days as the norm for web developers, but what does it mean? how big is that stack? how healthy is it for software developers to strive for that badge of honour? I would like to show you a different approach to the full-stack, one that allows automation and technology to augment your skills. With the rise of no-code/low-code & zero-config platforms, we can now focus on solving real problems and creating better experiences for all our users, while ensuring that our work is relevant and meaningful as we head into the next decade of software engineering.
