Title: **Demystifying server-side rendering in React**

Duration: 30min

Tags: React, Performance, Server Rendering 

One of the greatest features of React is that it can render both on the client and on the server. During this session, we will walk through the process of rendering React apps on the server. The technique behind SSR is surprisingly easy, but it can get complicated very fast. Adding one element of the React ecosystem at a time will give us a better perspective into building modern universal apps!

I recently wrote this article (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/demystifying-reacts-server-side-render-de335d408fe4) about the same topic, so many of the ideas presented will be based on the steps from the article. We will add one element at the time in the mix and by the end of the talk we will have a fully working React-Redux web application rendered on the server.

* What are universal apps (the story of SPAs and SSR)
* What are the benefits of SSR
* When to use SSR
* Building a SSR application, one step at a time (React, React-Router, Redux, Prefetching Data, SEO concerns React-Helmet)
* Examples of frameworks that implement SSR (next.js, razzle.js)
