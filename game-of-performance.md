When you play the game of performance, you win or you die. Let's talk about the most important performance tips we need to take into consideration when building modern web applications. How fast should your page load? How much JS are you shipping to your users? How can you leverage the features of modern browsers?

In this talk I will highlight the 3 major battles that a frontend developer has to carry in order to obtain those crucial performance improvements in modern web apps. We will start from the browser and understand what the critical rendering path is and how we can optimize it. We will then move to the size of our app and go over a couple of tips and tricks for how to make our bundles and resources smaller and more efficient for the modern web. Finally, we will get deeper into the language level and see how we can improve JavaScript performance at run time. Expect a talk full of valuable resources and ideas that one can use to improve the performance of a modern web application.
