**tl;dr**

The web recently turned 30, so maybe it's time to sit down and reflect on where we are and what lies ahead of us. Imagine this talk as a dance between the developer and the user, whom both want to be the lead, both with their own needs and struggles. First we will settle the dispute, we will look at the development ecosystem and then we will see how that balances out the needs of our users. Then we will shift our attention towards automation and the impact of technology in our work.

**Long Version**

The web recently turned 30, so maybe it's time to sit down and reflect on where we are and what lies ahead of us. Humans are pretty bad at predicting the future, but in this talk I will do my best to support **three predictions** for the web ecosystem for 2020 and beyond.  

You might assume that this talk is about the latest tools and frameworks, or the hottest technology right now, but it's not. Instead we will focus on the higher level picture of the web development landscape in 2020. We will start from us, the developers, talking about our struggles and pains and about the state of our development ecosystem. 

But we will quickly shift towards the users, trying to balance our own needs with their needs. We are going to redefine user experience as the sum of all our users needs. In doing that we will underline the major focus point of frontend developers moving further.

In the last part we will talk about automation and the impact of technology in our work. Automation is, without doubt, our ally against repetition. But automation might also unlock higher levels of abstraction in building software. And to the surprise of many and contrary to popular belief, it may open the gates and empower more people to create rich experiences for others.
